# Workshop: Introduction to Markdown  

## 1. Objectives

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for adding simple formatting to plain text documents. It is very simple to learn and use, and is widely used for presenting content online, including websites and technical documentation. This is a Markdown document, and depending on how you opened it, you're either viewing the plain text source or a nicely formatted preview. If you are viewing the plain text source (you'll see some `#` characters if you are), then click *Open Preview to the Side* at the top of this editor to view the formatted preview.

In this workshop you will learn two ways to use Markdown, both of which will help you document and communicate the results of your data science projects:

1. Use Markdown cells in your (`.ipynb`) notebooks to annotate your code and describe your workflows. 

2. Create and edit standalone Markdown (`.md`) documents, just like this one.  

As an optional exercise, you can:

- Start using a Markdown document for note-taking during this course.

## 2. Markdown for notebooks

In the same folder as this document, you will find a notebook called:
> `workshop-toolkit-markdown.ipynb`  

It contains an illustrated tour of Markdown as it applies to (`.ipynb`) notebooks:

1. Locate the file in the *Explorer* view.  
   
2. Click to open the file in the notebook editor.  
   
3. Work through the notebook: you will see examples of all the key syntax.  
   
4. When complete, return to this point and continue.  

Note that the syntax that you've just worked through applies to (`.md`) Markdown documents as well as (`.ipynb`) notebooks.

## 3. Markdown documents

Visual Studio Code offers good support for editing Markdown documents. Try out these features:  
   
- **Preview**  At the top of the Markdown preview, locate the *Show Source* button.  
    - Click it to open a source editor for your Markdown file.  
    
    - Similarly, the source editor has a *Open Preview to the Side* button at the top which opens the preview.  
     
  
- **Linking source and preview**  When you have both source and preview open for the same document, editing and scrolling are synchronized:  
    - Changes in the source editor are immediately shown in the preview.  
    
    - Click on a line in the source file, the corresponding element of the preview is highlighted.   
  
- **Document outline**  The *Outline* section in the *Explorer* view shows the structure of the document broken down by headings. You can navigate the document by browsing items in the *Outline* section.  
  
- **Breadcrumbs**  At the top of the source editor are breadcrumbs which also show the structure of the document and allow navigation.

## 4. Note-taking with Markdown

This is an optional exercise.  

Try adding a new Markdown (`.md`) file to record your own notes during this course. You'll be able to take notes without the inconvenience of having to switch to another note-taking application.

1. Locate the `essential-data-science-2025/workshops` folder in the *Explorer* view.  
   
2. Right-click on the `workshops` folder and choose *New File* - a blank slot appears in the *Explorer* tree.
   
3. Type a name for the new file in the slot, for example `my-notes.md`, and press **return** on your keyboard
4. The file will open in a source editor.
   
5. Type your notes, add Markdown formatting as you go, and preview as described earlier.


Remember to save your notes - use Command+S (macOS) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux).  

To undo changes that you don't want to keep use Command+Z (macOS) or Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux).
